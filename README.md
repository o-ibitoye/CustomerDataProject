## Background

A collection of data from a company wishing to process its customer records for business purposes (acw_user_data.csv). The existing systems in place at the company only export to a CSV file, which is not in an appropriate format for analysis. The task is to prepare this data for further analysis by the company, including representation changes, filtering, and deriving some new attributes/metrics for them.

The number of records provided is significant; therefore, solutions are expected to be robust to varying types of data and values, offering a programmatic solution.

The CustomerDataProject.ipynb file shows the codes written for this task. The dataset is available, and the outputs are attached as well.
